    <h3>What's in a name</h3>
    Briseida is the Spanish form of the Greek name, Briseis. 
    I am neither Spanish nor Greek (that I know of). 
    My parents picked my name out of a book, little did they know 
    that Briseis is a character in the Illiad. 
    She is super cute and just living her life with her hubby Mynes, 
    when Achilles ravages her city and takes her as her concubine!!! 
    The audacity. He eventually has to give her up to Agamemnon for 
    additional dumb, misogynistic reasons and Briseis effectively 
    becomes the spoils of war. Truly tragic. 
    Trust no man.
